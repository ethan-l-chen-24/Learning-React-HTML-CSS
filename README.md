# Web-Dev-Coursera
## ethan-l-chen-24

Hello all! This repository contains all of my practice files building a webpage from the ground up using HTML, CSS, and Javascript! 
This is my first time diving into _front-end development_, so I have decided to take a free, online Coursera course called `HTML, CSS, and Javascript for Web Developers
by Johns Hopkins University`.
It will cover the basics of HTML, CSS, and Javascript, as well as creating and uploading a website to a domain on the internet.

Additionally, to contain all of my web development learning within the same repository, I have also pushed all of my commits while following along a React crash course on Youtube. The name of the video I watched was `React JS Crash Course 2021` by `Traversy Media` <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7ejDZ8SWv8&t=1224s" title="Video">[Link]<a>. This video taught me the basics of React and had me build a basic task-manager website using React.
